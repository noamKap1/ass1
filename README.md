# ass1

# Our implementation:

In our solution to the K-NN problem we define the Flower object by the Iris' type and sizes. We get the csv input files as an arguments to our main function
(there is a need to write the paths of these files, we already did that for the given csv input files but if it's paths change, the examiner must change too in our main function). We read the information to two vectors of Flowers. One for the classified ones, and one for the unclassified.

Then we iterate over all of the unclassified Flowers and classify them by creating and bubble sorting an array of distances between the unclassified object and the classified ones. Once it's sorted we create a map which contains of the first K elements in the array, and we insert every element, when the value of it is it's
Iris type. Finally, we iterate over the map and return the most common type. 
This proccess we do for every unclassified object, and three times, for the three distance calculating methods.
We write the newly classified objects to three different distance methods csv's, according to the expected output rules.

# compiling and running:
write mkdir ass1.
write cd ass1.
first the unclassified and classified file you gave us should be placed with the cmake-build-debug folder in the assigment folder and the files we sent uploaded.
compile with the command:
g++ *.cpp -std=c++11
and then run with the command:
./a.out 5
(in our computer you need to refresh too)

# changes
the changes we made:<br />
We had a line with include which we deleted. This line was a typing error which led to a compilation error.<br />
We had an error in std::runtime_error which we changed. This line was a syntax error which led to a compilation error.<br />
We had a mistake which we used argc and not argv[1] in the places which we used the given argument. This little error ruined our reading process.<br />

Our mistake was that we didnâ€™t  run the program properly on linux (because of poor understanding) and therefore we missed this errors.<br />
In our IDE (Clion) the program ran as necessary.<br />
We hope this mistakes will not have a big affect on our grade and we are sorry for the trouble.
